# Code Submission for COMP3330 - Assessment 2

To execute the script, please ensure that *iris.data* is in the same directory as *svm_rbf_iris.py*.

**Dependencies:**
* scikit-learn (1.7.0rc1)
* pandas (2.2.3)
* matplotlib (3.10.3)
* PyQt6 (6.9.0)

Created using Python 3.13.3 in the PyCharm 2025.1.1 IDE. All dependencies can be installed via pip, or the package manager in PyCharm.


### Notes
Generative AI (ChatGPT 4o) was used to aid in the creation of this code as I am unfamiliar with the individual scikit-learn functions and their associated parameters for use in Machine Learning. All code was manually reviewed and refactored, and comments added to outline the methodology on which the code is based on.
